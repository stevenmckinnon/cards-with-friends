# Cards With Friends

Welcome to Cards with Friends, the online multiplayer cards game based on [Cards Against Humanity](https://cardsagainsthumanity.com/)
 
## About the project

I made this project to allow my friends and me to stay connected through social online gaming. We tried other similar games but they never really felt modern enough or offerred the flexibility we were looking for.

## Project Setup

The frontend is a React based project, using Material Design. 

The backend is built using Firebase for auth and user/data storage. 

### Running the client

To run the client first you must run 

```
yarn

Then to start the client:
```
yarn start
